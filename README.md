Patch for Sakura Clicker

#### This patch makes this suggestive game much more suggestive.
#### Currently only main hero and default outfit is supported.

Maybe we will make more outfits/monsters later, but sprites alteration requires a lot of manual work.  
Donations surely will stimulate it a lot ;)
